There are currently two types of CROW:

- **CROW1** - a desktop application made with Tkinter.
- **CROW2** - a web application made with Flask.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Data-Linkage/Clerical_Resolution_Online_Widget.git
   cd Clerical_Resolution_Online_Widget
   ```

2. Decide which version to run (see [Version Differences](#version-differences))
   and consult the corresponding documentation:

   - For desktop or external users, see [CROW1][crow1].
   - For internal ONS use, see [CROW1][crow1] (desktop) or [CROW2][crow2] (CDP).

### Documentation

The most up-to-date documentation can be found in the folders corresponding to
each version. There you will find instructions for setting CROW up for your
project as well as instructions you can give to your clerical matchers on how to
run CROW once it is set up.

## Version Differences

The following should help you decide which version of CROW to use:

- CROW1 is a desktop application, whereas CROW2 is integrated with the Cloudera
  Data Platform (CDP) and can access files stored in S3 buckets.
- CROW1 can only read CSV files, whereas CROW2 can only read parquet files.
- CROW1 consists of two separate scripts - `CROW_pairwise.py` and
  `CROW_clusters.py` - for if your data contains pairs or clusters of records.
  CROW2 is a single script (`flask_new_flow.py`) that treats all data as
  clustered. If you want to review pairwise data with CROW2 your data should be
  in wide-file format and should still contain a cluster ID column (with only a
  pair of records in each cluster).
- CROW2 has various accessibility (based on [Web Content Accessibility
  Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0][accessibility-guidelines]) and feature improvements
  over CROW1, including:
  - Adjustable font formatting and style.
  - Muted colour brightness and highlighting.
  - Zoom and read-aloud functionality.
  - 'Select all' button for faster cluster review.
