; USEFUL INFORMATION:

; Welcome to the config file that makes the CROW, the Clerical Resolution Online Widget, work with the data you are clerically reviewing!

; This is a file that you will have to edit and put next to the CROW_master.py in the filespace that contains the clerical matching files. Once you have edited it, you and your clerical matchers can simpy run the CROW_master.py from whatever Python IDE you are using. This way no one will have to edit any code. 

; As you can see this file is laid out into sections. Below is the section titlesalong with a description of what each section does. NOTE - do NOT change the section title names (i.e. the bits in square brackets ([])), only change the information underneath each section title. 

; [custom_settings] - decide whether to include a commentbox in the CROW to allow your matchers to make any comments on what they are viewing.

; [matching_files_details] - tell the CROW where your matching files exist. This will be your file path.

; [dataset_names] - tell the CROW what your dataset names are called.

; [column_headers_and_order] - in this section you need to tell the CROW what your column headers are called and in what order you want them to appear. For instance, common column headers are First Name or Postcode. See [column_headers_and_order] for more detail. Essentially these are the variables that may be shared across the one or more datasets you have linked. You can specify the order you want them to appear in by typing in ', <your order number>' after the title. See [column_headers_and_order] for more detail.

; [columnfile_info_and_order] - in this section you need to tell the CROW what column variables you have in your clerical matching '.csv' files, what dataset each column variable belongs to and what order they should be displayed in (these will displayed from left to right). 
; TIP 1 - When telling the CROW what columns variables you have, it helps if you have one of your clerical matching files open when your are entering in what column variables you have. Any spelling errors or other inconsistencies will cause CROW to crash.
; TIP 2 - When entering what dataset each colun variable belongs to, PLEASE ENSURE they are consistent with what youhave entered in the section [dataset_names]. 
; TIP 3 - When entering in the order you would like each column variable to appear in, PLEASE ENSURE you enter in numbers that are consistent with the number orders you entered in section [column_headers_and_order]. For instance, if in the [column_headers_and_order] section you are displaying First_Name in column order 1 (i.e. Firstname = First_Name , 1), then the order of your column variables should also have a column order 1 (i.e. fname_a = firstname_a , A , 1 //// fname_b = firstname_b , B , 1).                         

; SECTIONS TO EDIT: 

[custom_settings]
; if commentbox is 1 it will include a commentbox, if commentbox is 0 it will not. 
; num_records_checkpoint is the number of records between each backup/checkpoint save.

commentbox = 1
num_records_checkpoint = 5

[matching_files_details]
; Enter the exact pathway where your clerical matching files exist 

file_pathway = _____Your_File_Pathway_____

[dataset_names]
; tell the CROW what your linked datasets are called. 
; Simply edit A or B to what ever your datasets are called. 
; if you wanted to add a dataset C then you can do this by 
; creating a new variable and entering in its name. 
; E.G. dataset3_name = C

dataset1_name = A
dataset2_name = B

[column_headers_and_order]
; tell the CROW what your column headers are and in what order
; you want to order them in. This should be entered after the '=' sign 
; in the following order:
;                  Example = <Column_Title> , <Column_Order>

fname = First_Name , 1
mname = Middle_Name , 2
sname = Surname , 3 
DoB = DoB , 4
Sex = Sex , 5
pcode = Postcode , 6
Address = Address , 7

[columnfile_info_and_order]
; tell the CROW what column variables you want to display 
; and be clerically reviewed. Tell The CROW what dataset this
; belongs to and in what order. 
; This should be entered after the '=' sign in the following order:

; Example = <Column_Variable_From_CSV> , <Dataset_Column_Variable_Belongs_To> , <Column_Order>

fname_a = fname_a , A ,  1
fname_b = fname_b , B , 1
mname_a = midname_a , A , 2
mname_b = midname_b , B , 2
sname_a = sname_a , A , 3
sname_b = sname_b , B , 3
dob_a = dob_a , A , 4
dob_b = dob_b , B , 4
sex_a = sex_a , A , 5
sex_b = sex_b , B , 5
pcode_a = pcode_a , A , 6
pcode_b = pcode_b , B , 6
address_a = address_a , A , 7
address_b = address_b , B , 7
