<h2 style="font-family:arial;">About</h2>
  
<p style="font-family:arial;"> Welcome to CROW, the Clerical Resolution Online Widget, an open-source project designed to help data linkers with their clerical matching needs once they have linked data together! 
<br>
  <br>
The CROW reads record data from parquet files in HDFS/Hue, presents it in an easy to read and compare format and has tools that can help the clerical matcher with decisions. 
<br>
  <br>
The aims of the CROW are to: 

<ul style="font-family:arial;">
  <li>Meet the clerical matching needs of both large- and small-scale projects. </li>
  <li>Get clerical matching results faster compared to other free to us software. </li>
  <li>Minimise error during clerical review by presenting record pair data one at a time and in an easy to read and compare format. </li>
  <li>Be easy to use for the clerical matcher when reviewing record pairs and the clerical coordinator setting up the project. </li>
  <li>Be open and transparent, so the community can use the software without restrictions. </li>
</ul>  
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:arial;">Accessibility</h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;">
The CROW team have attempted to follow and implement accessibility requirements to the best of their ability, but due to time and resource constraints it is not likely all requirements 
<br>
  will be met in the first release. However, the CROW team aims for continuous development of the tool to meet accessibility requirements with future releases. 
<br>
  <br>
The accessibility requirements are adapted from the ‘Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0’, which covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. 
  <br>
  For more information on this, please visit: <b><a href="https://accessibility.18f.gov/checklist/">Accessibility Guide Checklist</a></b>
<br>
  <br>
Following these guidelines aims to make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, 
  <br>
  limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. 
<br>
  <br>
The following features have been implemented in the latest release of CROW: 
<ul style="font-family:arial;">
<li>Font formatting and style can be changed by the user depending on their preference</li> 

<li>Text size can be changed by zooming in and out </li>

<li>Arial font is size 12 is the default font size – for accessibility reasons </li>

<li>Brightness of items hovered over and then highlighted are ‘muted’ for users who find bright colours uncomfortable </li>

<li>The user interface can be zoomed into with no issues, magnifying what is on screen without making its contents illegible  </li>

<li>‘Read aloud’ works on CROW if opened in Microsoft Edge – but not in Google Chrome </li>
  </ul>

<p style="font-family:arial;"> The following features have not been implemented in the latest release of CROW, but will be considered for future releases: 
<ul style="font-family:arial;">
<li>Keyboard-tab accessibility</li>  

<li>Background colours can be changed by user depending on their preference</li> 

<li>Text colour and size </li>

<li>Records that are no longer available after matching are ‘greyed out’ so it is clear to users </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> If you have further accessibility requirements/needs please contact the team directly.
