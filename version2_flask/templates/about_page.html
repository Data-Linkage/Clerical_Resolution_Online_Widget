<h2 style="font-family:arial;">About</h2>
  
<p style="font-family:arial;"> Welcome to CROW, the Clerical Resolution Online Widget, an open-source project designed to help data linkers with their clerical matching needs once they have linked data together!
<br>
  <br>
The CROW reads record data from parquet files in HDFS/Hue, presents it in an easy to read and compare format and has tools that can help the clerical matcher with decisions. 
<br>
  <br>
The aims of the CROW are to: 

<ul style="font-family:arial;">
  <li>Meet the clerical matching needs of both large- and small-scale projects. </li>
  <li>Get clerical matching results faster compared to other free to us software. </li>
  <li>Minimise error during clerical review by presenting record pair data one at a time and in an easy to read and compare format. </li>
  <li>Be easy to use for the clerical matcher when reviewing record pairs and the clerical coordinator setting up the project. </li>
  <li>Be open and transparent, so the community can use the software without restrictions. </li>
</ul>  
</p>  
<br>

<h2 style="font-family:arial;"> Functionality of the buttons</h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;" > 
  <b>Match and Non-Match:</b> Begin matching by first reviewing the presented record cluster by clicking either the ‘Match’ or ‘Non-Match’ buttons. When you want to match records, select them using the square boxes in the first column of the table. If you click Match or Non-Match an ID will be populated in the match column. When you decide, it will advance you to the next cluster. You can view the ID on the clusters you’ve just matched by pressing back. This is especially useful when reviewing clusters to help clearly see which records are still left to match/non-match.  
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Highlight:</b> Toggle ‘Highlight’ between record pairs/clusters using the button. This will highlight differences between the first row and subsequent dataset rows and text will be highlighted where there is a difference. <i>Note:</i> This highlights text characters in place. To turn this off, just press the button again.  
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Select all:</b>  Toggle ‘Select All’ to select all records. To unselect all, just press the button again. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Comment Box:</b> In the Comment box, you can add information that you feel is useful for that record pair or cluster. This comment will appear in a row adjacent to your records once you are finished matching/non-matching a selection of records.  
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <b>Clear Cluster:</b> If you press the ‘Clear Cluster’ button it will clear any decisions in the cluster (i.e., results in the match column.). So, it will take you back to the start of a given cluster. It will also clear the comments.  
  <br>
  <br> 
  <b>Save:</b> Save your current matches using the ‘Save’ button. At any time, you can click ‘Save’ and your progress will be saved. You can then come back to that file later and the filename will be marked as ‘_[your_userID]_inProgress.csv’. <b>Please ensure you save before exiting.</b>
  <br>
  <br> 
  <b>Changing font size: </b> To adapt font size; use your browsers usual zoom functionality (or Ctrl z+/Ctrl z-)

<h2 style="font-family:arial;">Accessibility</h2>
<p style="font-family:arial;">
The CROW team have attempted to follow and implement accessibility requirements to the best of their ability, but due to time and resource constraints it is not likely all requirements 
<br>
  will be met in the first release. However, the CROW team aims for continuous development of the tool to meet accessibility requirements with future releases. 
<br>
  <br>
The accessibility requirements are adapted from the ‘Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0’, which covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. 
  <br>
  For more information on this, please visit: <b><a href="https://accessibility.18f.gov/checklist/">Accessibility Guide Checklist</a></b>
<br>
  <br>
Following these guidelines aims to make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, 
  <br>
  limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. 
<br>
  <br>
The following features have been implemented in the latest release of CROW: 
<ul style="font-family:arial;">
<li>Font formatting and style can be changed by the user depending on their preference</li> 

<li>Text size can be changed by zooming in and out </li>

<li>Arial font is size 12 is the default font size – for accessibility reasons </li>

<li>Brightness of items hovered over and then highlighted are ‘muted’ for users who find bright colours uncomfortable </li>

<li>The user interface can be zoomed into with no issues, magnifying what is on screen without making its contents illegible  </li>

<li>‘Read aloud’ works on CROW if opened in Microsoft Edge – but not in Google Chrome </li>
  </ul>

<p style="font-family:arial;"> The following features have not been implemented in the latest release of CROW, but will be considered for future releases: 
<ul style="font-family:arial;">
<li>Keyboard-tab accessibility</li>  

<li>Background colours can be changed by user depending on their preference</li> 

<li>Text colour and size </li>

<li>Records that are no longer available after matching are ‘greyed out’ so it is clear to users </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> If you have further accessibility requirements/needs please contact the team directly.
