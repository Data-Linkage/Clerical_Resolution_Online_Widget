; Welcome to the config file that makes the CROW, the Clerical Resolution 
; Online Widget, work with the data you are clerically reviewing!

; This is a file that you will have to edit and put next to the CROW_master.py
; in the filespace that contains the clerical matching files. 
; Once you have edited it, you and your clerical matchers can simpy run the 
; CROW_master.py from whatever Python IDE you are using. This way no one will 
; have to edit any code. 

; As you can see this file is laid out into sections. Below is the section titles
; along with a description of what each section does. NOTE - do NOT change the 
; section title names (i.e. the bits in square brackets ([])), only change the 
; information underneath each section title. 

; [custom_settings] - decide whether to include a commentbox in the CROW to allow
;                     your matchers to make any comments on what they are viewing.
; [matching_files_details] - tell the CROW where your matching files exist. This will 
;                            be your file path.
; [dataset_names] - tell the CROW what your dataset names are called.
; [column_headers_and_order] - in this section you need to tell the CROW what your 
;                              column headers are called and in what order you want them 
;                              to appear. For instance, common column headers are
;                              First Name or Postcode. See [column_headers_and_order]
;                              for more detail.
;                              Essentially these are the variables that may be shared
;                              across the one or more datasets you have linked. 
;                              You can specify the order you want them to appear in by
;                              typing in ', <your order number>' after the title. See
;                              [column_headers_and_order] for more detail.
; [columnfile_info_and_order] - in this section you need to tell the CROW what column  
;                               variables you have in your clerical matching '.csv' files, 
;                               what dataset each column variable belongs to and what order
;                               they should be displayed in (these will displayed from left
;                               to right). 
;                               TIP 1 - When telling the CROW what columns variables you have,
;                               it helps if you have one of your clerical matching files
;                               open when your are entering in what column variables you have. 
;                               Any spelling errors or other inconsistencies will cause CROW to 
;                               crash.
;                               TIP 2 - When entering what dataset each colun variable belongs
;                               to, PLEASE ENSURE they are consistent with what youhave entered 
;                               in the section [dataset_names]. 
;                               TIP 3 - When entering in the order you would like each column variable 
;                               to appear in, PLEASE ENSURE you enter in numbers that are consistent
;                               with the number orders you entered in section [column_headers_and_order]. 
;                               For instance, if in the [column_headers_and_order] section you are 
;                               displaying First_Name in column order 1 (i.e. Firstname = First_Name , 1),
;                               then the order of your column variables should also have a column order 1
;                               (i.e. fname_a = firstname_a , A , 1 //// fname_b = firstname_b , B , 1).                         
; 


[custom_settings]
; if commentbox is 1 it will include a commentbox, if commentbox is 0 it will not. 
; num_records_checkpoint is the number of records between each backup/checkpoint save.

commentbox = 1
num_records_checkpoint = 5


[matching_files_details]
; Enter the exact pathway where your clerical matching files exist 

file_pathway = insert file path

[dataset_names]
; tell the CROW what your linked datasets are called. 
; Simply edit A or B to what ever your datasets are called. 
; if you wanted to add a dataset C then you can do this by 
; creating a new variable and entering in its name. 
; E.G. dataset3_name = C

dataset1_name = Census
dataset2_name = Hogwarts

[column_headers_and_order]
; tell the CROW what your column headers are and in what order
; you want to order them in. This should be entered after the '=' sign 
; in the following order:
;                  Example = <Column_Title> , <Column_Order>

fname = First_Name , 1
mname = Middle_Name , 2
sname = Surname , 3 
DoB = DoB , 6
Sex = Sex , 5
pcode = Postcode , 7
Address = Address , 8
Ethnic = Ethnicity, 4

[columnfile_info_and_order]
; tell the CROW what column variables you want to display 
; and be clerically reviewed. Tell The CROW what dataset this
; belongs to and in what order. 
; This should be entered after the '=' sign in the following order:

; Example = <Column_Variable_From_CSV> , <Dataset_Column_Variable_Belongs_To> , <Column_Order>

fname_a = fname_Cen , Census ,  1
fname_b = fname_Hog , Hogwarts , 1
mname_a = midname_Cen , Census , 2
mname_b = midname_Hog , Hogwarts , 2
sname_a = sname_Cen , Census , 3
sname_b = sname_Hog , Hogwarts , 3
dob_a = dob_Cen , Census , 6
dob_b = dob_Hog , Hogwarts , 6
sex_a = sex_Cen , Census , 5
sex_b = sex_Hog , Hogwarts , 5
pcode_a = pcode_Cen , Census , 7
pcode_b = pcode_Hog , Hogwarts , 7
address_a = address_Cen , Census , 8
address_b = address_Hog , Hogwarts , 8
ethnic_a = ethnic_Cen , Census , 4
ethnic_b = ethnic_Hog , Hogwarts , 4
