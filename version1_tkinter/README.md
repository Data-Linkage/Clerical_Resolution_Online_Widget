# CROW1

Here you will find everything you need to get started with the tkinter version
of CROW.

The `docs` folder contains guidance on the setup and use of CROW1.

## Utils

The `utils` folder contains some scripts that may be useful when working with
CROW1. Each script will contain a module-level docstring at the top of the file
that will contain usage instructions.

### Cluster-to-pairwise

The `cluster_to_pairwise.py` script will convert data that works with the
cluster version of CROW1 into a format that works with the pairwise version. The
script will group the data by cluster and data source, and keep only the
unique information from each data source per cluster.
