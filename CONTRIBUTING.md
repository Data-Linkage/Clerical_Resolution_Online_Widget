## Code style

- We name variables using few nouns in lowercase, e.g. `mapping_names`
  or `increment`.
- We name functions using verbs in lowercase, e.g. `map_variables_to_names` or
  `change_values`.
- We use the (numpydoc)[https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html]
  format for documenting features using docstrings.

## Review process

1. When we want to release the package we will request a formal review for any
   non-minor changes.
